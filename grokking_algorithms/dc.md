# Divide and Conquer 

Divide and conquer is similar to recursion, in that it uses recursion to solve algorithms with a base case.

Example, image a list of numbers. You want to sum them up. Well, all you need to do is add a base case of a list of length one and then return that value. Then the rest of the time you should pull an element off the end of the array and then add it to the sum of calling your "sum" function with the array of numbers reduced by one.
